23,3026,T,"I threw you a curve in there; I said two hours. So we normally know speed as miles per what, guys? ",Q,SK,-7.836923,8.40057
24,3026,S,Hour. ,Rs,SK,-8.235512,13.681264

27,3026,T,"So of course, the farther you go in the less time it faster or slower? ",Q,PD,1.6892854,2.7771945
28,3026,S,Faster. ,Rs,PD,-16.762573,8.519814
29,3026,T,"Faster, right?  It would go faster. ",Fy,PD,-14.812909,-17.778492
30,3026,T,Or the less distance you cover in the same amount you’re probably going… ,Fq,PD,-0.3152208,-10.9343
31,3026,S,Slower.   ,Rs,PD,-5.5741396,14.791251
32,3026,T,"Slower, so speed is all about that distance and time relationship. ",Fs,MT,-16.422888,8.514012

41,3026,T,"Yeah, I’m totaling up what? A list of what? ",Fq,SK,1.203712,-5.4672236
42,3026,S,The speeds. ,Rs,SK,11.661907,-6.003992
43,3026,T,Correct.,Fy,SK,6.150177,-20.245928
44,3026,T,"I’m dividing it by how many different speeds I went, ok?  ",E,OD,-2.070091,-0.004722779
45,3026,T,"Because I started biking, and I can bike around White Rock Lake  ",E,OD,1.043723,-5.6239204
46,3026,T,and sometimes I’m going 15 miles an hour; ,E,OD,-8.230823,13.568845
47,3026,T,"it depends if I’m going down a hill or not, ",E,OD,11.706209,-5.9067116
48,3026,T,but at the end of my trip I look at my average speed and it might tell me I went an average of 10 MPH. ,E,OD,-3.7858183,-11.242731
49,3026,T,So that means it takes all my speeds and it’s going to average it all together. ,E,OD,-3.7865434,-11.241307
50,3026,T,"So on the average I did about 10 MPH even though at some points I may have gone faster or slower, right? ",E,OD,-5.599099,14.8030615
51,3026,T,Are you going to go the same speed as you drive to school?   ,Q,PD,-7.673718,9.721019
52,3026,T,What do you do between? ,Q,PD,-11.129359,-9.873672
53,3026,S,Stop. Go. ,Rs,PD,-6.404814,2.4724827
54,3026,T,"Stop, at a stop light, and then what do you do? ",Fq,OD,-6.1304145,2.82925
55,3026,S,Go. ,Rs,OD,-11.214396,-9.902766
56,3026,T,"You go, and as you start leaving the stop light what do you do? ",Fq,OD,-6.740099,19.55189
57,3026,T,As you leave you get a little what?,Q,OD,-7.711944,0.07670587
58,3026,S,Faster. ,Rs,OD,-16.912987,8.653384
59,3026,T,You go a little faster. ,Fs,OD,-7.8653727,0.28770232
60,3026,T,So the average speed is just talking about all your speeds averaged together. ,E,MT,-7.2167196,-6.798394
61,3026,T,"Now if I want to take a speed instantaneously, ",E,EX,-2.1560354,0.082692966
62,3026,T,"if I want to take a speed at one instance, that means at that one moment I want to know how fast I’m going, ",E,EX,-2.2343433,0.14767341
63,3026,T,so what kind of scale - what tool do I use to try to measure how I’m going at one particular second? ,Q,EX,-3.7393353,-11.289165
64,3026,S,Odometer. ,Rs,EX,6.164465,-20.32094
65,3026,T,What’s that called? ,Fq,EX,-7.823388,0.07762275
66,3026,S,Speedometer. Odometer. ,Rs,EX,18.853756,-4.5128813
67,3026,T,What’s the difference between an odometer and a speedometer? ,Q,EX,18.827728,-4.4868617
68,3026,S,A speedometer tells you how fast you’re going. ,Rs,EX,12.3397045,-16.27686
69,3026,T,"Right, the speedometer tells you how fast you’re going. ",Fs,EX,-0.37947968,-10.874661
70,3026,T,It tells you your instant speed at that one moment. ,E,EX,12.385799,-16.230806
71,3026,T,"What does the odometer do, guys? ",Q,EX,-8.311352,14.220215
72,3026,S,How far you traveled? ,Rs,EX,1.5956502,-4.905937
73,3026,T,"Right, how far you traveled. ",Fy,EX,-5.6061125,14.802099
74,3026,T,So you can get in your car and you can reset the odometer so if you’re about to leave your house ,E,EX,-4.941347,-17.669357
75,3026,T,"and you want to calculate how good you’re driving, how fast you’re driving, you can set it to zero, ",E,EX,-5.970775,3.0059488
76,3026,T, and as you get there it’s going to calculate your miles and then you can calculate your time. ,E,EX,-2.0547643,-0.028029205
77,3026,T,"Ok, well send it. Ok. Alright, let’s see our class average. Hold on, we’ll do that in a minute. Alright, so let’s go over your little mini quiz here. So I asked you in your own words what equilibrium meant.",P,,-3.713071,-11.315654
78,3026,T,"We have several examples with Mr. Denero and a class. Let’s see what you told me here. Alright, equal amount, the same, two equal things - I think this is supposed to say balance. I think you’re [inaudible], but I understand that’s balance. Equal and in balance. Now whenever you give a definition of a word you don’t want to use the same form of the word, so if I say it’s equilibrium, I don’t want to see equal in the definition.",P,,11.424196,-5.5776367
79,3026,S,Some did what? ,Q,SK,8.965802,-7.9307694
80,3026,T,Ignore. So the best thing you can probably tell me is if it’s balanced. Remember we talked about equilibrium where it’s reached a stable stage or it’s in balance. ,E,SK,10.377762,6.3732696
81,3026,T,"Think about the volcano. If the volcano is building up pressure, is that equilibrium, if it’s got pressure underneath it? ",Fq,SK,0.6533484,4.709449
82,3026,S,Yeah. ,Q,OD,1.6229914,-5.0217323
83,3026,T,"Yeah,  if it’s building up pressure? ",Fq,OD,1.7687875,2.3554745
84,3026,S,No. ,Ry,OD,-10.918753,-9.9807205
85,3026,T,"No.  Is the pressure greater or less underneath the crust as it is on the outside? Where’s there the most pressure. Think about it. If your volcano is building up pressure, is it going to be greater or less than the air pressure outside the volcano? Hello, Cory, is it greater or less? ",Fq,PD,0.6601499,4.701963
86,3026,S,Less. ,Rs,PD,-11.045179,-9.74316
87,3026,T,"Huh? Exactly; you’re not listening. Marquis, is it greater or less? ",Fq,PD,-6.7044272,19.516043
88,3026,S,I think less. ,Rs,PD,1.7909149,2.417864
89,3026,T,"Inside the volcano, before it erupts?",Fq,PD,0.8355165,4.50262
90,3026,S,It’s greater. ,Rs,PD,1.7943759,2.3990204
91,3026,T,It’s greater. ,Fy,PD,1.7663872,2.3979812
92,3026,T,"Now before it balances out it’s going to do what? If it wants to reach equilibrium, what does that volcano have to do? ",Q,PD,10.307081,6.443943
93,3026,S,Erupt.,Rs,PD,6.3109365,-20.412823
94,3026,T,"It’s going to erupt, because the whole point is the pressure under the crust vs. the pressure outside, it’s not the same.",Fs,PD,1.6346924,2.8464017
95,3026,T,"It’s in disequilibrium and we have to balance it out by making it the same, so it’s got to erupt. Same thing with succession. ",E,PD,-5.9644623,3.0146635
96,3026,T,"Johnny, explain to me what speed is. ",Q,SK,11.70276,-5.893954
97,3026,S,Speed is how far you move in a specific time? ,Rs,SK,1.5875052,-5.11874
98,3026,T,"Ok, how far you move in a certain amount of time. ",Fs,SK,1.0857314,-5.5853415
99,3026,T,Ok? So how many of you all…How many of y’all sped to school this morning?,Q,EX,-8.197206,13.869449

105,3026,T,"In cars, ran. ",P,,-0.3328475,-10.921984
106,3026,T,"It’s funny, because when I say speed to school you think that you’re going too fast, right? ",E,OD,1.6970819,2.7859752
107,3026,T,"But really, the actual definition of speed is involving what two units as Johnny just told us?",Q,SK,8.564521,-6.6755695
108,3026,T,What two units does it involve? ,Q,SK,-7.683987,-6.0791817

488,3026,T,"Acceleration is the change of velocity, ok?",Fy,SK,-1.5634663,8.814956
489,3026,T,"So we know velocity means I must be in motion, I can change my speed, and I have to be moving in a particular direction, ok? ",E,SK,-2.3164754,0.42122254
490,3026,T,"And I’m moving right now, so do I have velocity? ",Q,OD,-7.7742863,8.70059

516,3026,T,"Ok, ",Fy,OD,6.32065,-20.39723
517,3026,T,so he had to walk back for how many seconds? Count. How many seconds? How many seconds did he have to walk backwards for?,Q,OD,8.502376,-6.6250315
518,3026,S,Three. ,Rs,OD,-11.067734,-10.04577
519,3026,T,"Three, right? ",Fy,OD,-16.769127,8.594216
520,3026,T,So he had to judge it. How did we get that straight line? ,Q,PD,-7.9325943,21.349022
521,3026,S,Just stay there. ,Rs,PD,1.6672361,-4.6054974
522,3026,T,"He stopped, right? ",Fy,PD,-19.330412,7.3582954
